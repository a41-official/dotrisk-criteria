# 🛠️ Restaking.risk Metadata Update Guide

Welcome! 👋 This repository exists to help **AVS (Actively Validated Service) providers** contribute metadata about their reward and slashing policies to [Dotrisk](https://restaking-risk.vercel.app/), a public dashboard powered by A41 restaking insights.

We want to make sure your AVS is accurately represented, and that the wider community can understand and evaluate your protocol’s mechanisms.

> ❓ **First time here?** Don’t worry! This guide walks you through everything you need to know.

## 🧭 What Is This For?

This repository is used to collect **structured metadata** from AVS teams. Your submitted data helps populate two key pages in our frontend:

### 1. Protocol Page — *Reward / Slashing Policy Status*

This section shows whether your AVS has clearly defined policies.

For more details, see [Reward / Slashing Policy Status](https://narrow-cello-dab.notion.site/Protocol-AVS-Page-s-Data-Update-Guide-1dec62052b8e801d8f6afab80d1a5f0a#:~:text=3.1.%20Protocol%20Page%20%3E%20Reward%20/%20Slashing%20Policy%20Status%20(Open%20to%20All))

### 2.  AVS Page — *Operator Set Slashing Mechanism*

This section evaluates your AVS’s slashing mechanisms using a standardized framework.

For more details, see [Operator Set Slashing Mechanism](https://narrow-cello-dab.notion.site/Protocol-AVS-Page-s-Data-Update-Guide-1dec62052b8e801d8f6afab80d1a5f0a#:~:text=3.2.%20AVS%20Page%20%3E%20Operator%20Set%20Slashing%20Mechanism%20(Open%20to%20All))
